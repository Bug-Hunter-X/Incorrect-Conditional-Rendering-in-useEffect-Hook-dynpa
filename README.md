# Incorrect Conditional Rendering in useEffect Hook

This repository demonstrates a common error in React applications involving incorrect conditional rendering logic within the `useEffect` hook.  The example showcases how improper handling of state updates within the `useEffect` hook can lead to unexpected behavior and potential performance issues.

## Bug Description:

The provided code uses `useEffect` with a conditional statement (`if (count > 0)`) to log a message only when `count` exceeds 0. However, this approach doesn't handle the initial render where `count` is initially 0. This can lead to the conditional logic never executing when expected.  Furthermore, it creates unnecessary re-renders as useEffect runs on every state change, even if the conditional statement doesn't execute.

## Solution:

The solution addresses the issue by refining the logic within the `useEffect` hook to correctly account for the initial render and optimizing the conditional check to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
